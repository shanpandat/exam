Assign variables to pieces of the problem: Let n = number of computer game units sold with the old strategy Let p = price of computer game per unit with the old strategy 2. We know that before the new strategy, the total revenue was $100. Based on the number of copies sold at the price of the old strategy: np = $100. 3. We know that with the new strategy, the total revenue was $100. Based on 10 more copies sold and a $5 reduction in the price per unit: (n+10)(p-$5) = $100. 4. Expand this second equation: np - 5n + 10p - 50 = 100. 5. From the first equation, we know that np = $100, so plug that in for np: 100 - 5n + 10p - 50 = 100. 6. From the first equation, if we divide by n, we end up with p = $100/n. Plug this value in for p: 100 - 5n + 10(100/n) - 50 = 100. 7. Combine like terms: 50 - 5n + 1000/n = 100. 8. Subtract 50 from each side: 1000/n - 5n = 50. 9. Divide by 5: 200/n - n = 10. 10. Multiply through by n: 200 - n*n = 10n 11. Subtract 10n from both sides: 200 - n*n - 10n = 0 12.

However, do not be tricked into choosing A at this point. We want the number sold with the new strategy, not the old. 16. n=10 means 10 copies were sold with the old strategy.

Probability problems require the knowledge of all possible combinations (mathematicians call this the probability space), the total number of combinations that satisfy the condition you are looking for and the probability that the combination will occur. The die is fair all possibilities are equally likely. Let A, B, C represent all possible values for the 3 die tosses. A = {1,2,3,4,5,6} , B = {1,2,3,4,5,6}, C = {1,2,3,4,5,6} and a,b,c represent possible outcomes of A,B,C respectively. (mathematicians say a,b,c are elements of the set A,B,C). We are to solve for the sum of 3 die tosses to equal 16. In other words, we are looking for all possible combinations such that a + b + c = 16. 2. Each die toss has six possible outcomes. Tossing the die once gives six possible values. Tossing the die twice gives a total of ( 6 possibilities for the first toss) times ( 6 possibilities for the second toss) = 36 possible outcomes . Similarly, for three die tosses one has (6)(6)(6) = 216 possible outcomes. 3. The first die toss is from 1 to 6. Since the maximum sum of the final 2 die tosses is 6 + 6 = 12, the first dice toss must be at least 4 for the sum of all three tosses to be 16. 4. If the first die toss is 4 then the last two must add up to 12. This will occur for the case {4,6,6} which is a total of one possibility. 5. If the first die toss is 5 then the last two must add up to 11. This will occur for the cases {5,5,6}, {5,6,5} which is a total of two possibilities. 6. If the first die toss is 6 then the last two must add up to 10. This will occur for the case {6,4,6}, {6,5,5}, {6,6,4} which is a total of three possibilities. 7. Out of the 216 total possible combinations, 1+2+3=6 add up to 6. 8.

Assign variables to the groups of interest: Let b = the percent of students who took both classes (what we are interested in). Let f = the percent of students who only took a finance class. Let m = the percent of students who only took a marketing class. 2. We know that 40% of the students did not take either class, so 60% (=100% - 40%) must have taken either a finance class, a marketing class, or both. 3. This 60% is made up of those three distinct groups: those who took a finance class only, those who took a marketing class only, and those who took both: m+f+b=60%. 4. We know that 25% of the students took a finance class, which is made up of those who only took this class and those who took both classes: f+b=25%. 5. Likewise, 50% of the students took a marketing class, made up of those who only took marketing and those who took both: m+b=50%. 6. We are interested in finding the value of b (percent who took both classes). So solve these last two equations for f and m by subtracting b from both sides of each equation: f=25%-b. m=50%-b. 7. Now plug these values of f and m into the first equation: m+f+b=60% 50%-b + 25%-b + b = 60%. 8. Combine like terms to simplify: 75% - b = 60%. 9. Add b to both sides: 75%= 60% + b. 10. Subtract 60% from both sides: 15%= b. Thus the correct answer is D.</p>\r\n', '5', 'English', '14', 'yes', '0000-00-00', '2023-02-20', ''),

To make this problem easily understandable we will break into two parts: i. First, we will find out all the seven lettered words from the letters of word CLASSIC ii. Next, we will find out how many of these words will have the two C&#39;s together. The total number of words formed using the seven letters from the word CLASSIC is found by using the multiplication principle. There are seven places for each of the seven letters. The first place has 7 choices, the second place has (7-1) =6 choices, the third places has 5 choices and the seventh place has 1 choice. Hence, the total number of words formed is: = 7*6*5*4 * ... * 1 = 7! Notice that there are two C&#39;s and two S&#39; in the word, which can be treated as repeated elements. To adjust for the repeated elements we will divide 7! by the product of 2!*2! So, the total number of words formed is: 7!/(2!*2!) We need to find how many of these words will have the two C&#39;s together. To do this, let us treat the two C&#39;s as a single entity. So, now we have six spaces to fill. Continuing the same way as in the step above, we can fill the first place in 6 ways, the second place in 5 ways and the sixth place in 1 way. Hence there are 6! ways of forming the words. Once again, we will need to adjust for the two S&#39; which can be done by dividing 6! by 2!. Total number of 7 lettered words such that the two C&#39;s are always together = 6!/2! The fraction of seven lettered words such that the two C&#39;s are always together is: = (number of words with two C&#39;s together/total number of words) = (6!/2!)/(7!/[2!*2!]) = (2!/7) = 2/7 Hence the correct answer choice is A.</p>\r\n', '5', 'Math', '15', 'yes', '0000-00-00', '2023-02-20', ''),

Reasoning:- What evidence would help determine whether the herb&acirc;&euro;&trade;s histidine production is what enables it to thrive in metal-rich soils? The argument is that since the herb&acirc;&euro;&trade;s histidine chemically neutralizes the metals that are toxic to most plants, it must explain why the herb can thrive in metal-rich soils.
